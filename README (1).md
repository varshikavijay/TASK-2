This repository includes code implementing the K-means clustering algorithm to categorize retail store customers according to their purchasing behavior.
## Dataset:
Dataset Mall Customer Segmentation Data from Kaggle.This dataset contain both Testing and Training data
## Techniques:
The following techniques used in this project:
- K-means clustering algorithm

The K-means clustering algorithm is a popular unsupervised learning technique used for partitioning data into distinct groups, or clusters, based on similarities in their features. It iteratively assigns data points to clusters by minimizing the within-cluster variance, aiming to place each data point in the cluster whose centroid is closest to it. The algorithm starts by randomly initializing cluster centroids and then iteratively updates them until convergence. K-means is widely used in various fields, including data mining, pattern recognition, and customer segmentation, to uncover hidden patterns and structures within datasets.
